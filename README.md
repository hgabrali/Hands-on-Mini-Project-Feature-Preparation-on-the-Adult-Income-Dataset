# 🛠️ Feature Preparation on the Adult Income Dataset: A Mini-Project

This repository documents a hands-on exercise focused on applying essential **Feature Preparation** techniques to a well-known public dataset, resulting in a clean, model-ready final dataset.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary objective is to apply the first five crucial steps of the feature preparation pipeline to the Census Income dataset and document every decision made.

* **Objective:** Predict whether an individual earns **more than $50,000** or **less than or equal to $50,000** per year.
* **Methodology:** Follow the 5-step feature preparation process (Handling Missing Data, Outliers, Categorical Data, Scaling, and Feature Engineering).

## 📚 About the Dataset (UCI Adult Income)

| Feature | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source** | UCI Machine Learning Repository (Census Income Data) |
| **Size** | Approximately 32,000 rows and 15 columns |
| **Target Variable** | `income` (Categorical: `>50K` or `<=50K`) |
| **Missing Values** | Represented by the string value `" ?"`. These must be converted to `NaN` (Null) upon loading. |

## ⚙️ Feature Preparation Tasks (5 Steps)

Your task is to implement and document the following five steps rigorously:

### Step 1: Handling Missing Values ❓

* **Task:** Identify columns containing the missing value marker (`" ?"`).
* **Decision:** Determine the optimal strategy (e.g., dropping rows/columns, or **imputing** values).
* **Implementation:** Apply domain-appropriate imputation techniques for both numeric and categorical features.

### Step 2: Handling Outliers ❗

* **Task:** Explore and visualize numeric features (using histograms and boxplots) to detect extreme values.
* **Decision:** Select an appropriate thresholding method (e.g., IQR) and decide whether to **remove**, **cap** (windsorize), or **transform** the outliers.

### Step 3: Handling Categorical Data 🏷️

* **Task:** Locate all categorical features in the dataset.
* **Decision & Implementation:** Convert these features into a numerical form suitable for modeling. Experiment with both `pd.get_dummies()` and `OneHotEncoder`.
* **Reflection:** Which encoding method is preferred for a production environment, and why?

### Step 4: Feature Scaling ⚖️

* **Task:** Select a subset of prepared numeric features.
* **Implementation:** Apply and compare different scaling methods (e.g., **Min-Max Scaling** and **Standardization**).
* **Reflection:** Based on the distributions, justify the most appropriate scaling method for this dataset.

### Step 5: Feature Engineering ✨

* **Task:** Create at least **two novel features** that you hypothesize will improve income prediction.
* **Implementation:** Think about combining, transforming, or creating new groupings of existing variables.
* **Reasoning:** Clearly explain the rationale for each new feature and why it is expected to be a strong predictor.

## 📦 Deliverables

Upon completion, your Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file should contain:

1.  The complete **Python code** implementation for each of the 5 steps.
2.  Clear, concise **statements documenting all decisions** (drop/fill strategy, encoding method, scaling choice, etc.).
3.  The final, **clean, prepared dataset** ready for the next stage of modeling.

### Final Reflection Questions (To Be Answered)

* Which of the five feature preparation steps proved to be the **most challenging**, and what made it difficult?
* Based on your exploration, which features do you anticipate will be the **strongest predictors** of income (and why)?
* Did your handling of outliers significantly **change your understanding** of the dataset's distribution or central tendencies?

This is a hands-on mini-project: **You are responsible for investigating the data and making all consequential decisions at each stage.**
